      <p>
        The Service Delivery is an Application for the citizens who would like to report certain
        issues in their environment like dead streetlight,potholes,water,electricity and etc.
        When reported the problem will reach each member in the municipal responsible responsible for maintaining
        a certain level of service delivery and answering to citizens who have concerns or
        complaints about day-to-day functionality when it comes to fundamental services
        such as water, electricity, and sanitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is an overwhelming need for certain services to be attended to, citizens
        are unable to have their calls answered and voice heard when they try to get through
        to their particular municipality, leaving them feeling frustrated.

      <h2>Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        In many underdeveloped areas, residents face challenges such as poor infrastructure,
         slow service delivery, unreported issues, and lack of transparency. Citizens often struggle
          to have their complaints heard or resolved in a timely manner. With this application, municipal
           managers can track reported issues in real time, prioritize critical problems, allocate resources efficiently,
            and make informed decisions using AI-driven insights, ensuring that services reach those who need them most and
             improving the overall quality of life in these communities.

        To address these challenges, the application provides a central platform for reporting and managing issues, allowing citizens to submit
         complaints easily and track their progress. Municipal managers can analyze reports using AI, identify trends, and prioritize
          interventions, ensuring resources are allocated where they are most needed. By improving transparency, speeding up problem resolution, and
           enabling data-driven decision-making, the system offers practical, efficient solutions that directly improve service delivery and community wellbeing.
